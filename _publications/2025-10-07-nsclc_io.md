excerpt: 'This study aimed to evaluate mortality patterns and causes of death among older patients with advanced NSCLC before and after the introduction of I-O therapies in the United States, while also investigating factors associated with competing risks of NSCLC-specific and other cause-specific deaths in both periods. This study identified significant reductions in CVD- and NSCLC-related mortality during the post-IO period compared to the pre-IO period among older patients with advanced NSCLC.'
